Lambda is just one service which can be used
Lambda functions need a Role associated to it (PoLP)

Lambda are billded by request, time of duration and used CPU-Power

Duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 100ms. The price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function. The Lambda free tier includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.
